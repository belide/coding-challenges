# Coding Challenges

This is a fun experiment in trying to port Dan Shiffman's awesome [coding challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) to Clojure.

These challenges use the [Quil](http://quil.info) library which interacts with the [processing](http://processing.org) programming environment to make drawing 2d/3d drawings and animations super fun!

## Usage

Emacs - run cider, open a file and press `C-c C-k` to evaluate the file.

REPL - run `(load-file "src/coding-challenges/<filename>.clj")`
